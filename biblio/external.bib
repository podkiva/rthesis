For wideband beamforming, the TDF1B and FDFIB methods can provide the frequency-invariant beam-pattern over an arbitrarily wide bandwidth. The FDFIB method is applicable with arbitrary antenna arrays and suitable for switched beams and direction-finding approaches. The frequency-invariant beam-pattern can be designed with prescribed narrow main beam width and low SLL over a wide bandwidth by using two FDFIBs in a spatial interpolation process. For wideband DOA estimation, two main approaches based on the CSS method and beam-space processing has been introduced. The latest approach can provide lower resolution threshold, lower RMSE of estimate, and lower computational complexity. Finally, practical considerations in implementation of an antenna array regarding to array errors and mutual coupling have been considered. In the presence of array errors and mutual coupling, the performance of wideband DOA estimation is strongly degraded.},

  abstract     = {Many approaches have been studied for the array processing problem when the additive noise is modeled with a Gaussian distribution, but these schemes typically perform poorly when the noise is non-Gaussian and/or impulsive. This paper is concerned with maximum likelihood array processing in non-Gaussian noise. We present the Cramer-Rao bound on the variance of angle-of-arrival estimates for arbitrary additive, independent, identically distributed (iid), symmetric, non-Gaussian noise. Then, we focus on non-Gaussian noise modeling with a finite Gaussian mixture distribution, which is capable of representing a broad class of non-Gaussian distributions that include heavy tailed, impulsive cases arising in wireless communications and other applications. Based on the Gaussian mixture model, we develop an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for estimating the source locations, the signal waveforms, and the noise distribution parameters. The important problems of detecting the number of sources and obtaining initial parameter estimates for the iterative EM algorithm are discussed in detail. The initialization procedure by itself is an effective algorithm for array processing in impulsive noise. Novel features of the EM algorithm and the associated maximum likelihood formulation include a nonlinear beamformer that separates multiple source signals in non-Gaussian noise and a robust covariance matrix estimate that suppresses impulsive noise while also performing a model-based interpolation to restore the low-rank signal subspace. The EM approach yields improvement over initial robust estimates and is valid for a wide SNR range. The results are also robust to PDF model mismatch and work well with infinite variance cases such as the symmetric stable distributions. Simulations confirm the optimality of the EM estimation procedure in a variety of cases, including a multiuser communications scenario. We also compare with existing array processing algorithms for non-Gaussian noise.},

  abstract     = {The output of an array of sansors is considered to be a homogeneous random field. In this case there is a spectral representation for this field, similar to that for stationary random processes, which consists of a superposition of traveling waves. The frequency-wavenumber power spectral density provides the mean-square value for the amplitudes of these waves and is of considerable importance in the analysis of propagating waves by means of an array of sensors. The conventional method of frequency-wavenumber power spectral density estimation uses a fixed-wavenumber window and its resolution is determined essentially by the beam pattern of the array of sensors. A high-resolution method of estimation is introduced which employs a wavenumber window whose shape changes and is a function of the wavenumber at which an estimate is obtained. It is shown that the wavenumber resolution of this method is considerably better than that of the conventional method. Application of these results is given to seismic data obtained from the large aperture seismic array located in eastern Montana. In addition, the application of the high-resolution method to other areas, such as radar, sonar, and radio astronomy, is indicated.},

This report is concerned first with the multiple emitter aspect of this problem and second with the generality of solution.

The ML method (MLM) results from the application of the ML principle to the statistics of the observed raw data. The standard multiple signal classification (MUSIC) procedure, called MUSIC-1, is obtained as a brute-force approximation of the MLM. An improved MUSIC procedure, named MUSIC-2, is obtained by applying the ML principle to the statistics of certain linear combinations of the sample noise space eigenvectors. A procedure which compromises between the good performance of the MLM and the computational simplicity of MUSIC is a method of direction estimation (MODE-1) which is derived as a large sample realization of the MLM. A fifth method, called MODE-2, is obtained by using the ML principle on the statistics of certain linear combinations of the sample eigenvectors. MODE-2 is computationally less demanding than the MLM (it is of the same complexity as MODE-1) and statistically more efficient. A numerical comparison of these five DOA estimation methods is presented. It confirms the analytic results on their theoretical performance levels.<>},

Zero-memory nonlinear (ZMNL) functions may be applied to limit the influence of impulsive noise, but ZMNL pre-processing generally destroys the low-rank signal subspace. We develop a robust covariance matrix estimate that suppresses impulsive noise while also performing a model-based interpolation to restore the signal subspace. The approach is based on modeling the noise with a finite Gaussian mixture distribution, and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used for parameter estimation. The method is robust to noise model mismatch and works well with infinite-variance noise. Simulation results are included that illustrate the improved performance in detecting the number of sources and estimating the angles of arrival.},

As will be shown, the advantage of using an orthogonal basis of the signal manifold would allow solving the ML cost function in an iterative manner. In fact, we propose two algorithms based on OPML, i.e. OPML-1 and OPML-2, which exhibit lower computational complexity and faster convergence than existing ML algorithms.
