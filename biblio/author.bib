  abstract        = {In this paper we study the channel estimation problem for a CP-OFDM based hybrid analog-digital massive MIMO system. In contrast to a conventional MIMO system, two additional constraints need to be fulfilled. First, the analog precoding is achieved using only a phase shift network, which imposes constant modulus constraints on the elements of the RF precoding and decoding matrices. Second, there is just one common equivalent RF precoding or decoding matrix for all subcarriers. These constraints lead to a challenging channel estimation task that includes the training design. To estimate the channel at the receiver, a least squares (LS) method and a compressed sensing (CS) method with a single-stage or a two-stage design are introduced. Compared to the single-stage designs, the two-stage designs have a lower computational complexity. Sufficient conditions for a unique channel estimation are derived for both methods. Simulation results show that the CS method provides more accurate channel estimates than the LS method under mild conditions.},

  abstract        = {In this paper we study the parameter estimation problem of an OFDM based joint wideband SIMO radar and communication system. The parameters to be estimated are time delays, relative velocities, and angle of arrival (DoA) pairs of radar targets. Due to the wideband assumption the received signal on different subcarriers are incoherent and therefore cannot fully exploit the frequency diversity of the OFDM waveform. In order to estimate the parameters jointly and coherently on different subcarriers, we propose an interpolation based coherent multidimensional parameter estimation framework, where firstly the wideband system model is transformed into an equivalent narrowband system model, and then multidimensional parameter estimation algorithms can be applied. More precisely, a wideband R-D periodogram is introduced as a benchmark algorithm and a high-resolution R-D Wideband Unitary Tensor-ESPRIT algorithm is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed coherent parameter estimation method significantly outperforms the direct application of multidimensional parameter estimation algorithms to the wideband model.},

  abstract        = {In this paper we analyze adaptive classification algorithm for digital amplitude-phase modulated signals in flat fading channel with non-Gaussian additive noise, representing possible interference in the channel besides thermal receiver noise. We represent additive noise via normal mixture model, which is able to model various interference scenarios by choosing specific mixture parameters. The adaptive classification algorithm based on application of recursive form of Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for noise parameters estimation is proposed. It allows easy maximum-likelihood classification of the signal of interest using posterior probabilities computed in EM framework. This adaptive approach allows receiver classification algorithm to adapt to time-varying interference scenarios, since recursive form of EM algorithm updates mixture parameters estimates with every new sample obtained. In this paper we analyze the performance of our adaptive classification algorithm for a specific interference scenario expressed with particular interference mixture parameters. We compare its performance to classic optimal maximum-likelihood classification for Gaussian additive noise scenario, and also to algorithm with perfect knowledge of noise parameters.},

  abstract        = {Several new algorithms have been proposed recently for near-field target localization and parameter estimation in Bistatic MIMO Radar systems. The new approaches include the usage of the exact spherical wavefront model, which avoids a systematic error introduced by the Fresnel approximation that is commonly made on impinging wavefronts in order to simplify the estimation problem. In this paper, we propose a new Tensorbased Near-Field Localization (TeNFiL) algorithm that utilizes the Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition of the received data in order to obtain high-resolution estimates of the parameters of the dominant targets that are automatically paired. Those parameters include the distances to the transmit and the receive reference antennas, the directions of departure (DoDs) and the directions of arrival (DoAs). TeNFiL is extended to the estimation in three-dimensional space and is applicable to arbitrary antenna array geometries. We develop a new reliability test and a new reliability measure for TeNFiL. The TeNFiL algorithm is based on the Semi-algebraic framework for approximate CP decompositions via Simultaneous Matrix Diagonalizations (SECSI). It is used to compute an approximate low rank CP decomposition of the noise corrupted measurements in a robust and efficient way. The simulations show that TeNFiL outperforms recent state of the art algorithms, especially if the targets are closely spaced.
